# bad-game
A bad game i made in lua. WASD or arrow keys to move. eat the fruit to get bigger. I was too lazy so the circle has a square collider. The colours are bad. 

# Play

install love2d, 
download this as zip, 
unzip into an empty folder, 
grab folder, 
open folder with Love2D, 
play, 
delete game

pretty sure this runs on Mac, Linux and Windows because Love2D is supported on those OS's and lua is aswell.
